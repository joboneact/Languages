Rust Visual C++ prerequisites

Rust requires the Microsoft C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2017 or
later, but they don't seem to be installed.

You can acquire the build tools by installing Microsoft Visual Studio.

  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Check the box for "Desktop development with C++" which will ensure that the
needed components are installed. If your locale language is not English,
then additionally check the box for English under Language packs.

For more details see:

  https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html

Install the C++ build tools before proceeding.

If you will be targeting the GNU ABI or otherwise know what you are
doing then it is fine to continue installation without the build
tools, but otherwise, install the C++ build tools before proceeding.

Continue? (y/N)
