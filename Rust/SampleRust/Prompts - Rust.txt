Prompts - Rust.txt

write a new detailed RustExplained.md markdown that explains features of Rust language plus pros and cons.  Include code examples.  add call out boxes for acronyms and advanced topics.  compare Rust language to C#, C++, c, python, go and similar languages.  the comparison should include pros and cons. finally include usage patterns plus popularity and third party support info.
Plus show typical packages, UI and web support. data support.
Include a learning path that shows what order to learn and which concepts may take more time.



Write a sample Rust program that shows the top features, including concurrency. Plus add comments, also show counter examples if possible.  other aeras to include are programming paradigms, functional programming, immutability, high-order functions, algebraic data types pattern matching. Plus show generics, type inference, package management and other abstractions.
Plus show common syntax and compile errors.  Any common coding patterns would help.
Add a function or source block at end that shows how Rust would interface with an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude.
